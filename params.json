{"name":"Here comes the sun...","tagline":"Data visualization poster","body":"#Welcome to “Here comes the sun” data visualization\r\n\r\nThis project was done during the Input/Output course at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam.\r\n\r\n#The task:\r\n\r\nProduce a data visualization about the International Space Station in relation to any other set of data.\r\n\r\n“Here comes the sun” is a data visualization that compares the hours of sun and Lux-values between the Earth and the ISS.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I find it fascinating that astronauts on the international space station see close to 16 sunrises and sunsets every day.\r\n\r\nThe International Space Station orbits about 354 kilometers (220 miles) above the Earth and travels at approximately 27,700 km/hr (17,211 mph), so it takes about 92 minutes to circle the Earth once. For this reason, every 45 minutes the astronauts on-board see a sunrise or a sunset, with a total of 15 – 16 of every 24 hours.\r\n\r\nThe sun values on earth are averages of a winter days in Germany.To see the result check the last image.\r\n\r\n###Some tests\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/lpaubielsa/HereComesTheSun/blob/master/img./probe2.jpg?raw=true)\r\n![](https://github.com/lpaubielsa/HereComesTheSun/blob/master/img./probe1.jpg?raw=true)\r\n\r\n###Final Poster\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/lpaubielsa/HereComesTheSun/blob/master/img./endplakatISS.png?raw=true)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
